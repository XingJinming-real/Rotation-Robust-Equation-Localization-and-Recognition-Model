# Rotation-Robust-Equation-Localization-and-Recognition-Model
This is the final project for Artificial Intelligence Training Course.

Abstract:
Object detection and optical character recognition are important application scenarios in computer vision. In this paper, based on the YOLOv5 target detection model and the CRNN text detection algorithm, we proposed a rotation robust equation localization and recognition model. The experimental results show that the proposed model can not only deal with normal circumstances, but also achieve satisfactory results for abnormal situations such as angle distortion and uneven illumination, which indicates its strong generalization ability. In addition, we adopt the knowledge distillation and weight quantization techniques to reduce the model size without losing the accuracy greatly, and deploy the model in the Web based on Falsk.
